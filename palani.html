	<p style="text-indent:50px;font-family:Times New Roman;text-align:justify"><b>Palani Murugan Temple, also named as ‘Arulmigu Dhandayuthapani Swamy Temple’ is dedicated to Lord Murugan, younger son of Lord Shiva and also known as ‘God of Tamil Language’. Here, He is named as ‘Lord Dhandayuthapani’. Palani Murugan Temple is one of the six abodes of Lord Murugan which are grouped as ‘Arupadai Veedu Temples’ and also a most important pilgrimage spot for devotees of Lord Murugan. This Temple is situated in the town of Palani in Dindugal district of Tamilnadu. This temple was constructed by the king Cheraman Peruman in the 9th century.

In Tamil literature the name Palani has been mentioned as ‘Podhini’, which later came to be called by the name Palani. This place is also called as Vaiyapuri Nadu, as this place was ruled by the King Vaiyapuri Kopperumbaegan earlier. The mythology is that Lord Maharishi Naradar visited Lord Shiva in Kailash and presented a fruit which is called ‘Gnaana Pazham’ (a divine fruit). Lord Shiva decided to conduct a competition stating that the fruit will be gifted to whichever of His two Sons circles the world and reaches first.</b></p>
<p style="text-indent:50px;font-family:Times New Roman;text-align:justify"><b>Accepting the challenge, His younger son Lord Murugan took His Vahan (Vehicle) peacock and started His journey around the world, whereas His elder son Lord Ganesh guessed that this world was His parents Lord Shiva and Goddess Shakti and circumambulate them. By seeing the enlightenment of Lord Ganesh, Lord Shiva awarded the fruit to Him. When Lord Murugan returned, He was disappointed that all His efforts had been in vain and left Kailash and stands atop the Palani hill. Lord Ganesh, Lord Shiva and Goddess Shakthi visited Palani hill to placate Lord Murugan telling that, “You are Yourself a divine fruit, then why do U need a fruit? “.</b></p>
